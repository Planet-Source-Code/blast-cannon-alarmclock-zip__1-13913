### Description

This is a very simple way to learn some basics about time/dates and using Timer controls. Many comments explaining almost every line of code. Contains the .exe, .vbp, .vbw, and .frm files for full and complete use and revision.
 
### More Info
 
You must only give it a time for the alarm to go off; also supports input of a message to remind you what the alarm was for! Handy for busy people and if you have trouble remembering things, like i do.

This is a small program and does not do anything incredible or fascinating. It will not trake over the world or make you on time for everyhting, but it might help. It was originally designed to be used as an instructional tool, because it is very simple and almost completely documented.

It returns the reminder that you wanted and beeps to notify you.

Multiple copies can be run at any time; does not cause any noticible errors or problems, but under heavy system demands can cause the system clock to slow down (because it calls the clock every 1/2 second to verify the time).
